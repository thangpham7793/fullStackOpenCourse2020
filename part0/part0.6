browser to server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa

//browser posts the new note as JSON and the server successfully creates a new note (201)

//in the browser, the callback function is invoked when a new note is submitted. The default action is prevented
//and instead, a new note is created inside spa.js before being pushed onto the list of notes Notes. Finally, the browser uses
//the updated list to re-render the page.
